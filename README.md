# rOpenSci lightning talks

If you are attending a conference, or have a chance to speak about the rOpenSci project at your institution, this slide deck will provide you with a useful starting point to quickly build and customize your own presentation. 

__How to use this repo__

1. Fork this repo into your own account
2. Edit the slides (at the very least your name on the opening slide).
3. Remove any slides that might be irrelevant to your audience.

Then make sure all the changes are on the `gh-pages` repo. Otherwise simply switch to `gh-pages` and  merge:

```
git checkout gh-pages
git merge master
```

Then you can present your talk at `http://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/ropensci_intro`

This frees you up from even bringing your own laptop if there already one at the venue. If you anticipate not having an internet connection, simply clone a copy first on to a thumbdrive before you no lose internet access.
